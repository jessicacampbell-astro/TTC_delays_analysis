# TTC Delays Analysis
The Toronto Transit Committee (TTC) operates Canada's most popular rapid transit system, with nearly 1 million rides every weekday. I performed an exploratory analysis of their [subway delay data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/) using SQL and Tableau to investigate performance metrics, YoY KPIs, time-dependent trends, and pain points for presentation to cross-functional teams and to inform performance strategies.
