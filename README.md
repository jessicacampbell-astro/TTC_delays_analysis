# TTC Delays Analysis
The Toronto Transit Committee (TTC) operates Canada's most popular rapid transit system, with nearly 1 million people riding the subway on weekdays. I performed an exploratory analysis of their [subway delay data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/) using SQL and Tableau to investigate performance metrics, YoY KPIs, time-dependent trends, and pain points for presentation to cross-functional teams and to inform performance strategies.

## Summary of Insights

**Delay distribution:** The were a total of 21,799 delays during 2023 for a total delay time of 63,623 minutes and an average delay time of 3 minutes. While the number of delays has increased since 2022 (18,290), the total time spent during delays (66,891 minutes) and the average delay time (4 minutes) are lower. Most delays were 7 minutes or less and lasted as long as 360 minutes.
